      <h3>Lower School</h3>

      <span class="duration">2010 - 2018</span>
      <p>
        I started my schooling at Trashiyangtse Primary School, which was formerly known as Trashiyangtse Lower Secondary School, 
        where I studied from Pre-Primary to Class 8 between 2010 and 2018. Those early years weren’t just about learning the basics; they helped me build confidence,
        make friends, and discover how much I enjoyed being in a learning environment.

      <h3>Middle School</h3>
      <span class="institution">Tshenkharla Central School</span>
      <span class="duration">2019 - 2020</span>
      <p>
        After completing Class 8, I joined <strong>Tshenkharla Central School</strong>
        as a boarding student for Classes 9 and 10. Living on campus was a new experience that taught me
        the importance of being independent and responsible. It was a time of both 
        academic and personal growth, and by 2020, I had developed a clearer sense of direction.

      <h3>Higher School</h3>
      <span class="institution">Baylling Central School</span>
      <span class="duration">2021 - 2022</span>
      <p>
        I chose the Wet Arts stream for my higher secondary education at Baylling Central School, 
        completing Classes 11 and 12 in 2022. Including Mathematics in my subjects was a deliberate choice;
        it challenged me in ways that stretched my thinking and helped me grow beyond the boundaries of traditional arts.
        Those two years weren’t just about academics; they were a time of self-discovery, 
        quiet resilience, and learning to trust the path I was carving for myself.

      <h3>Bachelor of Education in ICT</h3>
      <span class="institution">Samtse College of Education</span>
      <span class="duration">2023 - Present</span>
      <p>
        I’m currently in my third year at Samtse College of Education, pursuing a 
        <strong>Bachelor of Education in Secondary ICT.</strong> This journey has allowed me to deepen my understanding 
        <strong>of both teaching and technology,</strong> blending theory with hands-on experience.
        Looking back, each stage of my education has played a role in shaping who I am
        academically, personally, and professionally. 
        It’s been a path of growth, and it continues to guide me toward the goals I’ve set for myself.
